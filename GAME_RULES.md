## ⏱️ Round Flow

### 1. Ante Up
Everyone pays $0.50 to the pot (auto-deducted)

### 2. Deal
Each player receives 3 cards privately

### 3. Decision Time (10 seconds)
Choose one:
- **DROP**: You're safe, can't win this round
- **HOLD**: Compete for the pot (risk penalty if you lose)

### 4. Reveal
All decisions and held hands are revealed

### 5. Resolution

#### If EVERYONE DROPS:
- Pot carries to next round
- Continue playing

#### If 2+ PLAYERS HOLD:
- **Best hand wins the pot**
- **Losers must match the pot** (penalty added to next round)
- Continue to next round

#### If ONLY 1 PLAYER HOLDS:
**🎰 THE DECK SHOWDOWN**
- Server deals 3 cards to "THE DECK"
- Single holder's hand vs THE DECK's hand
- **Holder beats THE DECK**: 🎉 **HOLDER WINS GAME!**
- **THE DECK wins**: Holder matches pot, game continues

## 🏆 Winning the Game

There are TWO ways to win:

1. **Beat THE DECK** as the sole holder
2. **Last player standing** with money (all others eliminated)

## 💡 Strategy Tips

### NOTHING Rounds (1-3)
- Only pairs matter (besides three of a kind)
- High pair is strong
- No flushes/straights = less to worry about
- Consider holding with any pair

### Normal Rounds (4+)
- Straight flushes are rare but powerful
- Flushes and straights become viable
- Three of a kind still beats everything except straight flush
- Weak hands become more risky

### THE DECK
- Most games end via THE DECK showdown
- Being the sole holder is high risk/high reward
- THE DECK uses remaining cards from the shuffled deck
- If pot is huge, consider dropping unless you have a monster hand

### General
- **Early rounds**: Build pot, take calculated risks
- **Big pot**: Be more conservative (losing costs more)
- **Low balance**: Consider riskier plays (you're almost out anyway)
- **Psychology**: Everyone drops when pot is small, more holds when it's big
- **Position**: No advantage - all decisions are simultaneous

- Player B: 9♣ 8♣ 7♣ (Flush) - **WINS** in normal round
- Player C: 5♠ 5♦ 2♥ (Pair of Fives)
- **Result**: B wins $1.50 pot, A and C each pay $1.50 → next pot = $3.00

### Scenario 2: THE DECK Showdown
- Only Player A holds with A♠ A♥ A♦ (Three Aces)
- THE DECK gets: K♣ Q♣ J♣ (Straight Flush)
- **Result**: THE DECK wins! Player A pays $2.00, pot now $4.00, game continues

### Scenario 3: THE DECK Showdown (Win)
- Only Player B holds with 10♠ 9♠ 8♠ (Straight Flush)
- THE DECK gets: 7♥ 7♦ 2♣ (Pair of Sevens)
- **Result**: Player B beats THE DECK! **GAME OVER - Player B wins!**

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting NOTHING rounds** - Holding a flush in round 2 (it doesn't count!)
2. **Not watching the pot** - Holding with weak hand when pot is huge
3. **All dropping repeatedly** - Pot grows but nobody wins
4. **Not understanding THE DECK** - It's the main way games end!
5. **Slow decisions** - Timer is only 10 seconds!

## 🎮 Mobile Play Tips

- Keep cards private (don't show your screen!)
- Stable WiFi connection recommended
- Portrait or landscape mode works
- Add to home screen for best experience (iOS Safari)
